The "Mini-Database (Images)" game challenges users to guess animals based on descriptions. Players enter their name, then guess a random animal. Case doesn't matter, but misspellings are incorrect. Correct guesses continue the game; wrong guesses end it with an option to restart. The correct answer is shown after each guess.
